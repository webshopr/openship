 * cap_add, …); because it's JSONB, every addition is a pure TS shape-widening —
 * no migration. Runtimes that can't honor a key (e.g. the cloud runtime for

/**
 * Openship's own DEPLOY-TIME readiness gate — the sibling of, and NOT the same
 * thing as, `ComposeHealthcheck` above.
 *
 *   ComposeHealthcheck  = the Docker HEALTHCHECK directive. An arbitrary command
 *                         ("pg_isready", "curl -f /health") that the DAEMON runs
 *                         on an interval, forever, to mark a container
 *                         healthy/unhealthy. Custom conditions, continuous.
 *   OpenshipReadiness   = "did this thing actually come up?", asked ONCE by the
 *                         deploy pipeline between "started" and "ready". A port
 *                         that accepts a connection (optionally an HTTP path that
 *                         answers < 500), a static site whose doc-root has a
 *                         servable index, and/or a container that didn't fall into
 *                         a restart loop. It is the only one that can hold up — or
 *                         veto — a deploy.
 *
 * EVERYTHING HERE IS OFF BY DEFAULT, and that is the point. Omit the block and a
 * deploy does no post-start waiting whatsoever: activate → route → ready. The
 * pipeline still runs *advisory* probes once the deploy is live (`auditPorts` →
 * `meta.portCheck`, `auditStaticOutput` → `meta.outputCheck`, both re-runnable on
 * demand), so "is it listening?" and "will it 404?" are answered without a gate
 * that can delay or fail a working deploy.
 *
 * Turn these on when you want the deploy itself to refuse to go green — e.g. a
 * release pipeline that must not advance on a broken build.
 *
 * Settable per PROJECT (the project's `readiness` column) and per compose SERVICE
 * (`service.advanced.readiness`, which overrides the project's for that service).
