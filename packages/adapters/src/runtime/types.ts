  //     restart. Docker therefore does NOT implement `makeActive`; its

  //     snapshot + env (see modules/deployments/rollback/restore-plan.ts).

  // `archive`/`purge` are the RETENTION half and every runtime
  // implements them (capability flag: "rollback").

  // a no-op; purging an already-purged one is too.
