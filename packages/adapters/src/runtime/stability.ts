/**
 * Post-start stabilization: did the workload we just created actually STAY up?
 *
 * Creating a container is not evidence that it runs. A bad start command, a
 * missing env var, or an unbindable port exits within milliseconds — and because
 * production containers carry `restart: always`, docker immediately restarts
 * them, so `docker ps` shows "Up 1 second" forever and every point-in-time read
 * (including `getContainerInfo`, which deliberately collapses `restarting` into
 * `running`) reports a healthy service. That is how a deploy reported `ready`
 * with `successfulServices: 1` while the single service was crash-looping.
 *
 * So the deploy watches instead of glancing: poll the runtime for a short window
 * and judge the SERIES, not one sample.
 *
 *   crash loop  — restarts kept accumulating (>= crashRestarts) while we watched
 *   exited      — it is down for good with a non-zero exit code
 *   unhealthy   — its own compose `healthcheck` block says so
 *   completed   — exited 0 and its restart policy leaves it stopped: a one-shot
 *                 job that did its work, not a failure
 *   stable      — stayed up for the whole window (with a warning when it
 *                 restarted once or twice first — usually a dependency wait)
 *
 * Callers credit time a container has ALREADY been up (`alreadyRunningMs`), so a
 * whole stack costs one window rather than one per service.
