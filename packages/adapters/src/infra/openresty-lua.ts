/**
 * OpenResty Lua deployment - reads dedicated .lua files and writes them
 * to the managed server via the CommandExecutor (SSH / local shell).
 *
 * Architecture:
 *   No external dependencies on the managed server - everything runs on
 *   ngx.shared.dict zones in OpenResty shared memory.  No Redis, no
 *   file I/O on the hot path.
 *
 * Lua scripts live in ./lua/ as proper .lua files (readable, lintable,
 * editable with Lua tooling).  At deploy time we read them with
 * fs.readFileSync and push them to the server.
 *
 * Scripts:
 *   site_logger.lua      - log_by_lua: atomic counters + ring buffer + pipe
 *   pipe_log.lua         - module: pushes to shared-dict list for SSE pipe
 *   pipe_stream.lua      - content_by_lua: SSE endpoint (long-lived)
 *   mgmt_api.lua         - content_by_lua: REST analytics query endpoints
 *   geo_country.lua      - module: MaxMind GeoLite2 IP → country code
 *
 * Shared memory zones (declared in nginx.conf):
 *   analytics        256m - minute-bucket counters, daily geo, totals
 *   request_data     128m - raw-log ring buffers + live-log pipe queue
 *
 * Management port: 127.0.0.1:9145 (loopback only)
 *   GET /analytics?domain=&from=&to=   - minute-bucket time series
 *   GET /analytics/totals?domain=      - lifetime counters (or all domains)
 *   GET /analytics/geo?domain=&day=    - country breakdown
 *   GET /logs/recent?domain=&limit=    - recent raw requests
 *   GET /logs/stream?domain=           - SSE live stream
 *   GET /health                        - 200 ok

 * Build the OpenResty reload command from detected paths.
 *
 * Primary (both modes): `openresty -t` then `-s reload` — graceful, zero-downtime.
 *
 * What happens when reload FAILS is where this gets dangerous, because the wrong
 * recovery takes every site on the box down. Three layers, in order:
 *
 *   1. `opts.containerEdge` — set by the two container-edge providers, so for the
 *      paths we control the command CONTAINS no kill at all. Nothing to reason
 *      about at runtime.
 *   2. `/proc/1/comm` — a runtime backstop for any path that reaches the bare
 *      command while actually running inside the edge container (a caller that
 *      forgot the flag, `ensureLuaScripts` on a containerized box). The master IS
 *      pid 1 there, so `pkill` kills the container's init: the `docker exec`
 *      returns non-zero, registerRoute's self-rollback restores the PREVIOUS
 *      vhost, and the deploy reports "Routing failed" while every site blips.
 *      Restarting a dead master is the supervisor's job in that mode — fail
 *      loudly, surfacing the reload's real stderr.
 *   3. BARE host — a failed reload usually does mean "not running", so starting it
 *      is right. But recover WITHOUT a pattern kill: `pkill -f openresty` also
 *      matches a host-networked edge CONTAINER's master (see edge-check.test.ts),
 *      so the blind kill could take down the very edge it was recovering. Only
 *      start when no live master holds the pid file; otherwise report it rather
 *      than killing a process we can't identify.
