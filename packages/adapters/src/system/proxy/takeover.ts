/**
 * Edge takeover with config migration.
 *
 * Given the foreign proxy owning 80/443 and the sites parsed from its config,
 * this: snapshots what it's about to stop (rollback journal on disk) → stops &
 * disables the foreign proxy → installs OpenResty → re-registers the imported
 * sites as Openship routes → reuses/issues their certs → verifies. Any failure
 * rolls back (re-enable the foreign proxy) so the box is never left dark.
 *
 * The on-disk journal lets a crash mid-run be rolled back on the next boot
 * (recoverInterruptedTakeover), so an interrupted migrate can't strand 80/443.
