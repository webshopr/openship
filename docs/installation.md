# Installing Openship

Openship runs in three shapes. Pick by **who uses it** and **whether it must be reachable when your machine is off**.

| Setup | Use when | How Openship runs |
|---|---|---|
| **Desktop app** | It's just you. Private. | Control plane runs **on your machine**, drives your server(s) over SSH. Nothing about Openship is exposed to the internet. |
| **Self-hosted on a server** | A team, always-on, remote access, CI / push-to-deploy | Control plane runs **on a Linux box** at a public URL, login required, invite-only. |
| **Openship Cloud** | Zero ops | Managed for you. |

---

## Solo / private → use the Desktop app (recommended)

For a single operator this is the best model: the control plane lives **locally** and manages your servers end-to-end over SSH. Openship itself has **no public app and no open port** — the only thing that ever goes public is an app *you* give a domain to. Smallest attack surface, nothing to secure.

**When this is the wrong choice:** the dashboard is only up while your machine is. No teammate access, no access from your phone, and push-to-deploy webhooks need a stable public endpoint your laptop isn't. If you need any of those, run Openship on a server (below).

**Install:**
- Download for your OS at [openship.io](https://openship.io), or run `openship install` (fetches the desktop build).
- On first launch, connect what you want to manage:
  - **This Machine** — manage the local box.
  - **Another Server** — add a remote server over SSH (host, user, key). Test Connection, then manage it.

## Team / always-on → install Openship on a server

Two ways to stand up the control plane on a Linux box. Point your domain's **DNS A record at the server first**.

### A) From the Desktop app

Add the server (SSH), then **install Openship onto it like any other app** — pick the server, install Openship, and it runs as an always-on app on that box with its own domain. Use this to promote from "local desktop control" to "always-on server" without touching a terminal.

### B) With the CLI (on the server)

Install the CLI, then just run **`openship`** — an interactive wizard walks you through it: it creates the **first admin**, attaches your domain, and installs Openship as a boot service. Run `openship` again later to manage the running instance.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.openship.io | sh      # install  (or: npm i -g openship)
openship                                     # interactive setup, then control panel
```

Prefer a one-shot, flag-driven setup for CI / headless boxes? Drive `openship up` directly instead of the wizard:

```bash
openship up --public-url https://ops.example.com
```

- `openship up` installs the same background service the wizard does (starts on boot, auto-restarts), driven entirely by flags.
- `--public-url <url>` makes the dashboard reachable at your domain. Login is required; everyone else joins by invite only.
- `--managed-edge` also installs OpenResty + a free Let's Encrypt cert on the box and routes your domain to the dashboard — no separate reverse proxy needed. Omit it if you run your own proxy in front.
- One-off attached run instead of a service: `openship up --foreground`.

Once it's up, **Openship registers itself as an app** (dashboard → Apps → *Openship*): manage its domain, tail its logs, and see it *Live* like any other app.

## Docker

Self-host the pull-based stack — Postgres, Redis, API, dashboard, and the OpenResty edge on :80/:443. It lives in `docker/docker-compose.yml` and pulls published images (no build). Run it from the repo root:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oblien/openship.git && cd openship
cp .env.example .env
docker compose --env-file .env -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Linux only (the edge needs host networking); pin `OPENSHIP_VERSION` in `.env` for reproducible upgrades, and build from source instead with `-f docker/docker-compose.build.yml … up -d --build`.

> The repo-root `docker-compose.yml` is a different file — the SaaS / from-source control plane (builds from source, ships the marketing site, no edge or Docker socket). It does not self-host your apps.

### Postgres won't start (`could not write to file … Operation not permitted`)

If the `postgres` container aborts during first boot with an `initdb` error like `could not write to file "pg_wal/xlogtemp.NN": Operation not permitted`, the database volume is on a filesystem that rejects the low-level operations Postgres needs (this is an `EPERM`, not a permission/uid problem). New installs already keep the data directory in a subdirectory of the volume (`PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata`) to sidestep the common variants automatically, so first clear the aborted volume and retry:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down -v   # removes the half-initialized volume
docker compose --env-file .env -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

> **Upgrading an older raw-`docker compose` install** whose database was created at the volume root (before this default)? Set `PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data` in your `.env` before `up`, or Postgres will initialize a fresh empty database. Your old data is never deleted — it stays in the volume, unused, until you point `PGDATA` back. (The `openship up` CLI handles this automatically.)

If it still fails, the incompatibility is at the host/kernel level. Check:

```bash
systemd-detect-virt                                   # openvz / lxc  => the host is the problem
df -T "$(docker info -f '{{.DockerRootDir}}')"        # nfs/cifs/fuse/zfs => data-root is the problem
```

Fix by moving Docker's data-root to a native `ext4`/`xfs` disk (`/etc/docker/daemon.json` `"data-root"`, then restart Docker), or use a KVM-based VPS rather than an OpenVZ/LXC one. See [#350](https://github.com/oblien/openship/issues/350).

## Users & access (self-hosted)

- **Public signup is disabled after the first account.** The first admin comes from the `openship` setup wizard; with `openship up --compose` (or raw Docker) you register the first account in the dashboard. Everyone after joins by invite.
- **Invite teammates** from **Settings → Team**. They get an accept link at your instance's URL (so the instance needs to be reachable — a public URL or your LAN).
- **Lost the admin password?** Run `openship reset-admin-password` on the box (no sign-in needed; uses the local internal token).

|---|---|
| `openship login` / `logout` | Authenticate with a Personal Access Token (create one in dashboard Settings) |
| `openship context` | Manage contexts — which instance the CLI talks to |
| `openship token` | Manage personal access tokens |
| `openship api <method> <path>` | Authenticated request to any API route (like `gh api`) |

Add `--json` to most read commands for scripting.

## Quick decision

- **Just you, private** → Desktop app.
- **Team / always-on / public / CI** → `openship up --public-url https://… --managed-edge` on a server.
- **No ops at all** → Openship Cloud.
