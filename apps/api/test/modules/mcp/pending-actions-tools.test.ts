/**
 * MCP exposure for the blocked-deploy story.
 *
 * The gap this closes: `POST /:id/build/respond` was already a tool, but
 * `GET /:id/build` — the ONLY payload naming the prompt's action ids — was not.
 * An agent had the button and no way to learn what to press, so it either
 * guessed "free_port" or let the deploy time out. A tool is only usable if the
 * information needed to call it is also reachable, and these assert that both
 * halves are exposed together.
 *
 * Tools are generated from the route registry (see mcp-tools.ts): a route is a
 * tool if and only if its spec declares an `mcp` block. So dropping that block is
 * how this silently regresses, and that is exactly what these check.
