 * #336: compose-service `environment` is masked on every READ surface, and the
 * REAL values are exposed only through explicit reveal endpoints. The security
 * property this test locks in: reveal is strictly higher-privilege than viewing
 * the masked map — a read-only caller can see `••••••••` but can never fetch the
 * plaintext. If someone re-tags a reveal route down to `:read`, this fails.
