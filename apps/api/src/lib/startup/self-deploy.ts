/**
 * Deploy the control plane ITSELF as a real, deploy-only app.
 *
 * The Openship self-app (project `appTemplateId === "openship"`) runs as a bare
 * host process supervised by `openship up` (launchd/systemd). To make it a
 * genuine deployment — real row + `activeDeploymentId` + routes/SSL owned by the
 * normal pipeline — without a SECOND process binding the port, we create an
 * ADOPT deployment: `meta:{deployTarget:"local", runtimeMode:"bare", adopt:true}`.
 *
 *   - `ensureAdoptDeployment` — idempotent: create (or resume/activate) the
 *     adopt deployment and drive it through the pipeline's terminal path
 *     (`createQueuedDeployment` → `runtime.deploy({adopt})` → `onSuccess`). The
 *     bare runtime's adopt branch only health-probes the port; it never starts a
 *     unit. Infra-free (constructs a bare runtime directly, so it never touches
 *     OpenResty) → cross-platform.
 *   - `provisionSelfAppEdge` — the custom-domain edge: install toolchain +
 *     takeover (`ensureSelfEdgeInfra`), then register the route via the pipeline
 *     (`reapplyProjectLiveRoutes`) and issue the cert via the pipeline
 *     (`manageDomainSsl`). Linux + root only.
 *   - `registerSelfAdoptReconcile` — boot hook: backfill the adopt deployment
 *     for existing installs, sync `project.port` to the live dashboard port
 *     (drifts across restarts), self-heal the custom route/cert, refresh the
 *     public URL. Replaces the old `registerSelfEdge` hook.
 *
 * All auth/zero-auth/cookie gates stay env-driven elsewhere; nothing here feeds
 * a "public" signal into them.

 *    written the row, so reaching here means TLS is terminated by something we
 *    don't manage. Claiming otherwise would show a cert lifecycle we don't own.

 * 2. Promote it to PRIMARY. Domain rows accumulate — a free `*.opsh.io` from one
 *    run, a custom domain from the next — and whichever was written last used to
 *    keep the primary flag, which is how a never-verified subdomain came to be
 *    displayed as the project's address.
