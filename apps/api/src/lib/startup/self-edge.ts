/**
 * Managed-edge INFRA for the self-app's custom domain: install OpenResty +
 * certbot and, when the operator consents, take over / migrate an existing
 * proxy on ports 80/443. That's ALL this module does now — it no longer owns
 * routing or cert issuance. The route (hostname → 127.0.0.1:dashPort) and the
 * Let's Encrypt cert are registered by the NORMAL deployment pipeline via
 * `reapplyProjectLiveRoutes` + `manageDomainSsl`, resolved from the self-app's
 * adopt deployment (see lib/startup/self-deploy.ts). This keeps the self-app on
 * the same routing/SSL path as every other app — no duplication.
 *
 * Single-flight so the boot reconcile + the wizard endpoint never install twice
 * at once. Root Linux only (apt/dnf + certbot + systemd); a no-op elsewhere.
