/**
 * Single entry point for (re)applying a project's LIVE routes on a mutation
 * (service edit/delete, single-app publicEndpoints edit, webhook-domain set).
 *
 * Every edit path funnels through here so the routing surface is chosen ONCE,
 * consistently, and the webhook-proxy + best-effort semantics live in one place
 * rather than being copy-pasted per caller:
 *   - cloud project      → the runtime's page/workspace primitives
 *                          (cloud-route.service; the CloudInfraProvider routing
 *                          stub is a no-op).
 *   - self-hosted target → the DEPLOYMENT'S OWN routing provider (the local box,
 *                          or a remote server/sandbox over SSH) resolved via
 *                          resolveDeploymentRuntime — never the global
 *                          platform() singleton, which only ever targets the
 *                          orchestrator's local openresty.
 *
 * Callers compute the targets (the upstream differs: a service uses its
 * container-row IP, a single-app uses the deployment container IP, the webhook
 * domain uses the primary service IP) and hand them here; the dispatch, the
 * webhook-proxy re-attach, and the error tolerance are shared.
 *
 * Best-effort: the DB row is already committed by the caller, so a routing
 * failure logs and defers to the next deploy rather than failing the request.
