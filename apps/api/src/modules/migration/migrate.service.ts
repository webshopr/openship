/**
 * Adopt a discovered Docker stack as an Openship project.

 * Re-discovers the server (server truth, not client-sent config), filters to the
 * services the user selected, and creates a `services` project whose service
 * rows mirror the running containers. Same-server adoption reuses the EXISTING
 * named volumes in place by default (`namespaceVolumes=false`, original bare
 * names) so data survives — Openship would otherwise re-scope them to
 * `openship-<slug>-<name>` and mount empty volumes. A service the user marks
 * "copy" instead keeps the scoped name; its data is duplicated into that new
 * volume during moving_data, leaving the original volume untouched.
 *
 * This creates records only; deploy + cutover (stop old → start Openship's) is a
 * separate step so the user reviews before anything on the server changes.

 * (services/live-state.ts). Getting that wrong is what made an attached, running
 * service render "Stopped" — a label-filtered `docker ps` can never see it. A
 * LATER redeploy/teardown of the migrated project still won't recognize them by
 * label; that remains the accepted trade for "control it in place" on the same
 * server. `copy`/cross-server services take the deploy path.
 *
 * When `deploymentId` already exists (a mixed run whose `copy` services were just
 * deployed) the attach rows are added to THAT deployment and the active-deployment
 * pointer is left as the deploy set it. When it does not (pure reuse run) the row
