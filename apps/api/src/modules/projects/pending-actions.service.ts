 * @module pending-actions
 *
 * "What is waiting on a human here, and what exactly do they do about it?"
 *
 * Openship already knew all of this — it just never said it in one place. The
 * signals were scattered across an SSE session held in memory (a live decision
 * prompt), two flags derived from the active deployment's `meta`
 * (`awaitingDecision`, `routingUnsynced`), a failed deployment row, and the
 * domain table (unverified DNS, a broken cert). The dashboard rendered four
 * independent conditional banners on one tab plus per-domain hints on another,
 * and an API client could see none of it.
 *
 * Two things follow from having one list:
 *
 *   1. A blocked deploy stops disappearing. It fails, and a failed deploy never
 *      becomes `activeDeploymentId` — so every existing "needs attention" flag,
 *      all of which read the ACTIVE deployment, was structurally unable to see
 *      it. This reads the LATEST deployment too.
 *
 *   2. Each item carries its own resolution as data (`resolveWith`), so a caller
 *      does not have to know that a port-conflict prompt is answered with the
 *      literal action id "free_port". That was previously undiscoverable: the
 *      responder endpoint was exposed while the payload naming the ids was not.
 *
 * Read-only and side-effect free. Computed on demand, NOT folded into the project
 * read payload, matching how the other attention data works (`/commit-status`,
 * `/port-check`, `/routing/edge-status`) — so the hot list/detail reads pay
 * nothing for it.
