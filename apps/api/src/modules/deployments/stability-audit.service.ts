/**
 * Post-deploy stabilization audit — the gate between "the container was
 * created" and "the deployment is ready".
 *
 * Container-create success used to BE the success signal, which made a deploy
 * report `ready` (`successfulServices: 1`) while its only service was in a
 * restart loop: every point-in-time read shows "Up 1 second" because docker had
 * just restarted it again. This watches each container it was handed for a short
 * window and returns a verdict per container, with the exit code and last log
 * lines already folded in — so the failure is diagnosable from the deployment
 * record instead of needing an SSH round-trip to the box.
 *
 * Advisory about ITS OWN failures, decisive about the workload's: a runtime that
 * can't be sampled (no probe, unreachable host) yields NO finding, so an
 * unverifiable deploy behaves exactly as it did before this existed. Only a
 * conclusive reading fails a service.
