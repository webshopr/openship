/**
 * Built-image garbage collector.
 *
 * Every build mints a globally-unique tag (`openship/<slug>-<svc>:bld_..-svc_..`)
 * so a redeploy never overwrites the prior image — without a sweep, each deploy
 * server accumulates old builds (and dangling layers) forever. This reconciles
 * the images ACTUALLY on each host against the DB keep-set and prunes the rest.
 *
 * Safety model (see the audit): the ONLY images considered are those carrying
 * the `openship.project=<id>` label, which `labels()` stamps on FINAL build
 * images — base/third-party images (postgres, redis, mongo, …) are PULLED, never
 * labeled, and are therefore structurally unreachable here. The keep-set is the
 * exact imageRef of the active + pinned + newest-`rollbackWindow` deployments
 * (per deployment AND per compose service), so an in-use / rollback-target image
 * is never a candidate; the daemon's in-use 409 is a further backstop.
 *
 * Scheduled as the `images:gc` system job (see modules/jobs/job.registry.ts).
