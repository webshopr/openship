/**
 * How do we put a past deployment back on the air?
 *
 * This is the one place that decides, and it decides at ROLLBACK time from
 * what is actually still on the host — never from a flag frozen onto the
 * deployment row when it was created.
 *
 *   "unit-swap"        The runtime's artifact is a durable per-deployment UNIT
 *                      that survived the redeploy (bare: supervisor unit +
 *                      release dir; cloud: stopped workspace + disk). Restart
 *                      it in place — genuinely instant. Capability:
 *                      `unitRestore`.
 *
 *   "redeploy-pinned"  Docker. Containers are disposable and the redeploy
 *                      removed the previous one, so the durable artifact is
 *                      the IMAGE — which the rollback-window keep set already
 *                      retains for every project (see image-gc.computeKeepSet).
 *                      Restore = run the NORMAL deploy step with the target's
 *                      frozen config snapshot + env and its images PINNED, so
 *                      no build and no clone happen. Env, published port,
 *                      volumes, labels, network, healthcheck, routing, the
 *                      health gate and the stabilization watch all come from
 *                      the deploy pipeline rather than being re-implemented.
 *
 *   "rebuild"          No artifact left, but we know the commit. Same deploy
 *                      call, minus the pinned images: it re-clones and rebuilds
 *                      that commit. Slower, always correct.
 *
 * INVARIANT: a rollback never dead-ends. If the target's commit is known it is
 * restorable; the only question is instant vs rebuild. That's why "the artifact
 * was pruned" is not an error here — it's just the slower branch.
 *
 * Pure and synchronous by construction (image presence is resolved by the
 * caller and passed in), so every branch is unit-testable without a daemon —
 * same shape as image-gc's `computeKeepSet`.
