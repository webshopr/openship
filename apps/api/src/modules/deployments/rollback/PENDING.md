# Rollback — pending work + known limits

State as of 2026-07-31. This file lives next to the orchestrator so anyone
working on rollback sees the open questions before they pick up new work.

---

## Shipped (the current state)

**The restore model.** `planRestore` (restore-plan.ts) decides at ROLLBACK time
how a release comes back, from what's actually still on the host — never from a
flag frozen onto the deployment:

- `redeploy-pinned` — the artifact is there, so ONE `triggerDeployment` call
  replays the target's frozen snapshot + env with the artifact PINNED. No build,
  no clone, no git token (`snapshotNeedsGitSource`). The artifact is an image
  (server apps, per compose service) or a release DIRECTORY (static sites).
- `unit-swap` — bare/cloud only (capability `unitRestore`), where the artifact is
  a durable per-deployment unit that survived the redeploy: `makeActive`, a
  health probe, then the pointer, with a compensating swap-back on DB failure.
- `rebuild` — nothing retained, but the commit is known. Same deploy call minus
  the pins.

A restore is a REAL deployment (forward-only pointer), so it inherits the deploy
pipeline's env/ports/volumes/labels/network/routing, health gate, stabilization
watch, logs, SSE and notifications; `onSuccess` reuses the version number per
commit, so rolling back to v2 reads as v2. A failed restore leaves the current
release serving.

**Invariant: rollback never dead-ends.** If the commit is known, the release is
restorable — instantly when the artifact is there, by rebuild when it isn't. The
dashboard therefore has ONE rollback action whose confirm names the resolved mode.

**Retention.**

- `artifact_retained_at` is set on EVERY successful deploy (both rows), so the
  affordance is honest for every project. Nulled when retention purges.
- `resolveRollbackWindow` is the single resolver: explicit `rollback_window` →
  the disk-sized `rollback_window_computed` (NULL window = auto) → the instance
  default. Sized by `computeAutoRollbackWindow` in `@repo/core` from free disk on
  the daemon's data root (25%, capped, clamped 2–20), measured once per deploy
  inside the image reap and persisted, so prune/GC/UI do no I/O.
- `project.defaultRollbackStrategy` is a RETENTION preference read LIVE ("hold
  artifacts" vs "rebuild"), not a per-deployment decision — flipping it applies
  to existing history.
- Pins (`deployment.pinned`) are exempt and don't consume the window budget;
  capped at `MAX_PINNED_PER_PROJECT` (10).
- Purging NEVER removes an artifact another retained release still references
  (`computeKeepSet` gates both `prune` and the compose per-service reclaim) — a
  restore shares its source release's tag, so this is load-bearing.
- Per-service images resolve through `effectiveImagesAsOf`: a deploy only
  rebuilds what changed, so an untouched service's image comes from the newest
  row at-or-before the target that recorded one.

**Surfaces.** `GET /deployments/:id/restore-plan` serves the confirm copy and
gates the GitHub-access check (an instant restore needs no repo access). Retention
controls live in the project's Backup tab and in the deploy wizard's target panel,
both rendering one `RollbackRetentionCards`.

**Also shipped:** hard-link release-dir dedup on bare (`rsync --link-dest`);
`project.cloudArchiveStrategy` exists (default `'inplace'`; `'offload'` is a
forward-compatibility placeholder).

**Tests.** Unit: `restore-plan.test.ts` (every mode incl. static + partial compose
+ the no-snapshot guard), `pinned-artifacts.test.ts`, `rollback-prune.test.ts`
(window/pin math + the shared-artifact guard), `@repo/core/rollback-window.test.ts`,
`effectiveImagesAsOf` against a real PGlite.

Real-daemon E2Es under `apps/api/test/e2e/` — all skip when no socket is
reachable (CI has none); set `DOCKER_HOST` for Colima/Rancher/Podman:

- `rollback-docker.e2e.test.ts` — daemon-level facts: a redeploy REMOVES the
  container while the image survives; a restored container is complete (env,
  pinned loopback publish, volume, labels, caps) and serves the old bytes; prune
  withholds a shared image.
- `rollback-full-cycle.e2e.test.ts` — `rollback()` itself, single-app: the whole
  chain (plan → triggerDeployment → pipeline → deploy → onSuccess →
  onDeploymentReady) with NO clone and NO build, forward-only pointer, version
  reuse, symmetric roll-forward.
- `rollback-compose-cycle.e2e.test.ts` — `rollback()` on a two-service stack where
  only ONE service changed: both services pinned (the untouched one resolved
  backwards via `effectiveImagesAsOf`), nothing rebuilt, the unchanged service
  never disturbed.
- `rollback-build-restore.e2e.test.ts` — `RUN_DOCKER_E2E=1`: a REAL build of
  `fixtures/deploy/node`, then a restore that reuses its image.

The cycle tests fake exactly two seams — how the platform/runtime is LOCATED (so a
test box isn't handed OpenResty) and GitHub check emission. Everything else is
real: rows, orchestrator, planner, pipeline, containers.

**Bugs these tests found and fixed** (all pre-existing, all reachable outside
rollback too):

- `snapshot.productionPaths.length` crashed the pipeline on any release whose
  snapshot never set the field — un-restorable AND un-redeployable.
- Preflight judged a fully-pinned deploy by BUILD-config rules ("missing install
  command"), so adding a required field would retroactively break restores of
  every older release. Now exempt via `isFullyPinned`.
- `triggerDeployment` refused any project with no git URL and no localPath — which
  a registry-image-only adopted stack legitimately is. Now gated on whether the
  deploy actually needs source.
- Six of nine `service_deployment` write sites left `serviceName` NULL, so a
  restore of such a release could not key its per-service pins and rebuilt
  everything. All nine now record it.
- `normalizeRollbackWindow("")` returned 0 — a cleared form field meant "retain
  nothing".

## Pending — Cloud rollback architecture

### 1. Inline workspace model (one workspace per project, not per deployment)

Currently we run **one Oblien workspace per deployment**. 5 retained deployments = 5 stopped workspaces + their archives, each billing a workspace slot.

The proposed model: **one workspace per project**, releases as folders inside:

```
/app/
  releases/
    <depId-1>/
    <depId-2>/
    <depId-3>/
  current  →  releases/<depId-3>/       # symlink
```

Workload's `working_dir` points at `/app/current`. Rollback = `ln -sfn ... current` + `workload.restart`. Instant. One slot per project. Same Capistrano shape we use on bare.

**Why this isn't shipped:** ~300-500 line refactor of `CloudRuntime.deploy` (provision-once flow), `build.service.ts` (thread `previousDeploymentId` to cloud too, currently bare-only), `project` schema (add `cloudWorkspaceId`), and a slimmed `archive/makeActive/purge` for cloud. The user is going to address the static-compute path on Oblien's side first — once that lands, we revisit.

**Migration path** (no-breaking): add `project.cloudWorkspaceId`. On deploy, if set → inline path; if not → provision the project workspace and stamp the column. Old per-deployment workspaces stay addressable for rollback until they prune out. Models coexist; projects converge naturally.

### 2. Oblien "create workspace from archive" — not supported

We verified this against the docs (`/llms.mdx/docs/api/{snapshots,workspaces,images}` + concepts). Confirmed:

- Archive endpoints are workspace-scoped (`/workspace/{wsId}/archives/*`). No account-level store.
- `workspaces.create` has NO `restore_from`, `from_archive`, `archive_id`, `seed`, `hydrate`, `from`, `source`, `template`, or `clone_from` parameter. `image` (catalog ID) is the only source identifier.
- `GET /workspace/images` is the only images endpoint — catalog is read-only; no "commit workspace to custom image" flow.
- `POST /workspace/{wsId}/restore` only restores to the LAST snapshot of THAT workspace.

Conclusion: the "kill workspace + recreate from archive" pattern the user originally wanted is **not buildable** against the current Oblien API. We'd need either:
- A new Oblien endpoint we don't have (open question with their team), or
- External durable storage (R2/S3), which we explored and reverted because it's the wrong call for Openship Cloud (should be internal to the Oblien account).

The inline workspace model (item 1) sidesteps the requirement entirely.

### 3. `cloud_archive_strategy: 'offload'` is a placeholder

The DB column accepts `'inplace' | 'offload'`. Only `'inplace'` is wired. `'offload'` is reserved for a future self-hosted-to-external-S3 path — when self-hosted users want to ship their archives off-host. Not buildable for Openship Cloud (which would need internal Oblien support per item 2).

---

## Pending — orchestrator / data model

### 4. Atomic flip — RESOLVED for docker, narrowed for bare/cloud

A `redeploy-pinned` / `rebuild` restore is a normal deployment: the pointer only
advances on success, so there is no window to be inconsistent in. `unit-swap`
(bare/cloud) still swaps-then-writes, but now health-probes before committing and
swaps back on DB failure. The residual case — compensating swap ALSO fails — logs
a CRITICAL for manual reconciliation.

### 5. Per-environment rollback window

`rollbackWindow` is per-project. In practice production usually wants longer retention than preview. Either:
- Move the column to a per-environment table, or
- Resolve at runtime via `instance_settings` with an env-specific override.

Not urgent until preview deploys get heavy.

### 6. Multi-service compose rollback — RESOLVED

Compose restore no longer touches container ids at all (the dead
`DeploymentRef.serviceContainerIds` is gone). It pins per-service IMAGES —
resolved via `effectiveImagesAsOf`, so an unchanged service reuses the image
already on the host — and the compose deploy path reconciles against the
project's current service list as it does for any deploy. A service whose image
aged out simply falls into the buildable set.

### 7. Health-check gate — RESOLVED

`redeploy-pinned`/`rebuild` inherit the deploy pipeline's health check and the
#335 stabilization watch, and never advance the pointer on failure. `unit-swap`
probes `getContainerInfo` until running (skipped on bare, which can't inspect)
and reverts if it doesn't come up.

### 8. Hot-rollback for Docker (no container churn)

Still open, and now the main remaining latency win. A restore recreates the
container from the retained image (seconds). A true hot swap would keep the old
container running on a second loopback port and flip only the edge upstream —
sub-100ms — which needs the route layer to support an endpoint swap without
container churn, plus a policy for how long two versions may coexist.

---

## Pending — UX

### 9. Restore-mode chip in the deployments LIST

The confirm dialog names the resolved mode, but the list rows don't: showing
"instant" vs "rebuild" per row would need a presence check per row (an SSH round
trip), so it's deliberately resolved on demand instead. A cheap approximation
(artifact_retained_at + age) could pre-badge rows.

### 10. Rollback diff preview

Before clicking Rollback, show what changes between active and target: env vars diff, commit range, image diff. Vercel-style preview.

### 11. Bulk delete + bulk pin

Right now pin/delete is one-at-a-time per deployment row. Bulk select for retention cleanup.

### 12. Cloud (Oblien) restore still costs a workspace per release

`unit-swap` keeps cloud working, but one workspace per retained deployment is the
model item 1 above replaces. Unchanged by this work.

---

## Pending — bigger architectural moves (not on the near-term roadmap)

### 13. Content-addressable artifact store

Two builds producing byte-identical output pay 2× storage. A content-addressable store (build output → SHA → ref count) would dedupe across deployments and projects. Real win at scale; large new subsystem.

### 14. Bare runtime: full Capistrano (symlink-swap supervisor)

Today bare runs one supervisor unit per deployment. Full Capistrano would run one unit per project pointing at `current` symlink. Rollback = symlink swap + `systemctl reload`. Even faster than today's `stop(from)+start(to)`. Bigger refactor; current model works.

### 15. Filesystem-native snapshots on bare (zfs/btrfs)

Block-level dedup beyond rsync hard-links. Ties us to a filesystem; not portable.

---

## Decision log

- **S3/R2 offload for Openship Cloud** — rejected. Should be internal to Oblien; S3 belongs to a future self-hosted-only path.
- **`pause` instead of `stop` on archive** — rejected. Paused workspaces keep memory billed; the archive semantic must stay cheap.
- **Custom Oblien images from workspaces** — not available (read-only catalog).
- **Hard-link release dedup on bare** — shipped (via `rsync --link-dest`).
- **Redeploy-from-commit as the purged-artifact fallback** — shipped, then FOLDED
  INTO rollback itself: the restore planner picks `rebuild` automatically, so the
  dashboard has one action instead of two CTAs.
- **`DockerRuntime.makeActive`** — DELETED. Recreating a container by hand there
  could only ever be a lesser copy of `deploy()` (it shipped no env, no published
  port, no volumes, no labels), and Docker's artifact is the image anyway.
- **Restore as a new deployment row** — shipped (forward-only pointer). History
  grows by one row per restore; `onSuccess` reuses the commit's version number.
