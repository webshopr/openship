 * "Where to install" picker for the app wizards. Servers use the shared
 * mail-style `ServerSelector` dropdown (pre-selects the first/only server so the
 * wizard opens with a destination already chosen; collapses many into a
 * searchable list, carries its own "add server"), with Openship Cloud as a
 * sibling choice. Reports the pick as `{deployTarget, serverId, serverHost}`.
 *
 * DESKTOP ONLY gets a separate "this machine" card. On a server-host install the
 * Openship host is already registered as the `isLocal` "This Server" row (see
 * startup/self-server.ts) and appears in the selector above, so a second card for
 * the same box is not just redundant — it resolves to the same platform
 * (`resolveTargetPlatform` builds an identical selfhosted/socket/`provision:local`
 * target either way) while losing the server's `sshHost`, which is what makes a
 * port-only install's URL reachable. Picking it on a VPS yielded
 * `http://localhost:<port>`, useless from anywhere but the box itself. The main
 * deploy wizard already models the host purely as a server row (`useDesktopTargets`
 * offers servers + cloud, no local), so this keeps the two consistent.
 *
 * The same rule covers a host-control-disabled box: no `isLocal` row is created
 * there because the host is deliberately not a deploy target, and it isn't
 * desktop, so no local card either.
