/**
 * Shared pieces of "serialize a public endpoint (a domain + what it routes to)"
 * for the dashboard's four payload builders.
 *
 * There were four near-identical copies: the project Domains tab and the deploy
 * wizard's Domains step (byte-for-byte the same), plus two in the deploy build
 * payload. Each enumerated the fields it sent, so adding a field to
 * `PublicEndpoint` meant finding all four — and missing one silently drops it on
 * that path. The canonical-redirect work hit that twice: a save and a deploy that
 * each cleared a redirect the UI was showing.
 *
 * The two save builders were identical, so they collapse into
 * `validatedPublicEndpointPayload`. The two deploy builders genuinely differ in
 * wire shape and can't be merged without lying to one of the APIs:
 *   • the project API takes `port` as a NUMBER (project.schema.ts
 *     PublicEndpointSchema); the build API takes a STRING (deployment.schema.ts
 *     PublicEndpointInput);
 *   • the build payload's `domain`/`customDomain` are required strings, the
 *     project's are optional.
 * They keep their own shapes and share `redirectPayloadFields`, which is the part
 * that's easy to forget — so a new routing field is added in ONE place.

 * copy of this, and a redirect target list built from a different answer than the
 * one the save matches on would offer targets that don't exist.
