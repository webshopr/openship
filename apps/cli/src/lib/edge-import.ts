/**
 * Hand the sites migrated off a foreign proxy to the running stack's api, which

 * running edge container, the shared routing volumes and the docker socket).
 *
 * This is phase 2 of the compose takeover, and it is NOT optional: without it a
 * "Migrate N sites & take over" run stops the operator's nginx, binds 80/443, and
 * silently serves nothing for those N hostnames. Shared by `openship up` and the
 * interactive wizard so the two can't diverge on it again — the wizard used to
 * collect the sites and drop them on the floor.
