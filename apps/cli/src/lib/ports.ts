/**
 * The CLI's port STORAGE + operator-facing messaging.
 *
 * The resolution algorithm itself lives in `@repo/core/ports` (`resolvePortPair`),
 * shared with the desktop app so the two launchers can't drift — that divergence is
 * why the desktop one lacked the restart grace period. What's CLI-specific and
 * stays here: remembering the pair in `~/.openship/ports.json` (OS_DIR), the
 * documented 4000/3001 defaults, and the lines we print when a port moves.
 *
 * Ports are persisted so a restart REUSES the same origin when it's still free —
 * session cookies are bound to `localhost:<port>`, so a stable port is what keeps
 * you logged in across restarts. ports.json is also how `openship status`,
 * `doctor`, `reset-admin` and the control panel find the running instance, which is
 * why EVERY install mode (bare + compose) resolves through here.
