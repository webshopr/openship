## Quick Start

There's one decision to make first: **how you run Openship itself** (the control plane). Everything else is the same afterwards.

| If you're… | Run Openship as | Where your apps run |
|---|---|---|
| **Solo, one machine, no ops** | **Desktop app** | A server you connect over SSH, or Openship Cloud |
| **A team — or you want push-to-deploy / to host apps on your own box** | **Self-hosted server** (`openship up`) | On that box (Compose mode) — or out to another server / Cloud (bare mode) |
| **Not interested in running anything** | **Openship Cloud** | Managed sandboxes, zero setup |

> [!TIP]
> **Solo? Use the desktop app.** It runs Openship's control plane on your own machine *only while the app is open* — nothing is left running on an always-on server, nothing is exposed publicly. You only need an always-on server install once you want **push-to-deploy (CI/CD)**, **team access**, or to **host apps on that box** — the things that need a public, always-on endpoint.

### Solo — desktop app

The control plane runs locally and drives your servers over SSH. No login, no terminal, no public surface — download, open, done:

| Platform | Download |
|---|---|
| **macOS** (Apple Silicon) | [Openship-arm64.dmg](https://github.com/oblien/openship/releases/latest/download/Openship-arm64.dmg) |
| **macOS** (Intel) | [Openship-x64.dmg](https://github.com/oblien/openship/releases/latest/download/Openship-x64.dmg) |
| **Windows** | [Openship-win32-x64.zip](https://github.com/oblien/openship/releases/latest/download/Openship-win32-x64.zip) |
| **Linux** | [Openship.AppImage](https://github.com/oblien/openship/releases/latest/download/Openship.AppImage) |

Linux: `chmod +x Openship.AppImage && ./Openship.AppImage`. Already have the CLI? `openship install` fetches and launches it. Links always point at the newest release.

From the desktop app you connect a server (SSH) or Openship Cloud and deploy to it — the app itself doesn't host public apps on your laptop.

### Team / always-on — self-hosted server

Install the CLI (it bundles the API + dashboard), then run **`openship`** — an interactive wizard creates the first admin, wires your domain, and installs Openship as a boot service. Run it again anytime to manage the instance.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.openship.io | sh          # install  (or: npm i -g openship)
openship                                          # guided setup, then control panel
```

For CI / headless boxes, skip the wizard and drive `openship up` directly:

```bash
openship up                                       # install + start as a background service (boots + auto-restarts)
openship up --public-url https://openship.example.com   # + serve the dashboard on your domain (edge + TLS handled)
```

**`openship up` picks how it runs for you:**

- **On Linux with Docker → Compose mode** (the default). Brings up the full stack — Postgres, Redis, API, dashboard, and a containerized **OpenResty edge on :80/:443** — from published images. This is the flavor that **hosts your deployed apps on the same box**, with automatic domains + Let's Encrypt TLS. Force it with `--compose`.
- **Everywhere else → bare mode** (macOS, Windows, or Linux without Docker). A single lightweight process with an embedded database — an always-on control plane that **deploys apps out to a server (SSH) or Cloud**, like the desktop app but always on and login-required. Force it with `--bare`.

A self-hosted instance **always requires login** (the admin you create in setup). `openship open` opens the dashboard · `openship stop` stops it · `openship update` upgrades · `openship up --foreground` runs attached.

> **Preview an unreleased build (dev).** To run the CLI built straight from source — a branch, tag, or `main` ahead of the next release — install the from-source build:
>
> ```bash
> curl -fsSL https://get.openship.io/dev | sh                  # main (default)
> curl -fsSL https://get.openship.io/dev | OPENSHIP_REF=dev sh  # a branch/tag (var goes on sh, not curl)
> openship-dev                                     # same CLI, built from source
> openship-dev update                              # pull latest source + rebuild (no release needed)
> ```
>
> It installs as a **separate `openship-dev`** command with its own isolated home (`~/.openship-dev`) and boot service, so your production `openship` and its data are never touched. Needs Bun + git; it's an unverified dev build (the dashboard compile wants real RAM/CPU) — not a production path.

**Deploy a project:**

```bash
cd your-project
openship init            # link this directory to a project
openship deploy
```

Full server guide + complete CLI reference: **[openship.io/docs](https://openship.io/docs)**.

<details>
<summary>Self-host with raw Docker Compose (no CLI)</summary>

The self-hosted stack lives in **`docker/docker-compose.yml`** and **pulls** published images from GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io/oblien/*`) — no build tooling, no monorepo compile. Run it from the repo root:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oblien/openship.git && cd openship
cp .env.example .env          # then edit
docker compose --env-file .env -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

The stack is **postgres + redis + api + dashboard + edge**. The `edge` is OpenResty on **:80/:443** as a container (`network_mode: host`) — routing + Let's Encrypt, no bare host install. **Linux only** (host networking); on mac/win use `openship up` (bare). The `api` container mounts the host Docker socket so the control plane can build + run your apps as host containers — it's host-privileged through the socket, so run it only on a trusted host.

**Upgrade:** pin `OPENSHIP_VERSION` in `.env` for reproducible pulls, then `docker compose --env-file .env -f docker/docker-compose.yml pull && … up -d` (or just `openship update`). **Build from source instead:** add `-f docker/docker-compose.build.yml … up -d --build`.

> The **root** `docker-compose.yml` is a different file: it's the SaaS / from-source **control plane** (builds from source, ships the marketing site, no edge/socket). It does **not** self-host your apps — use `docker/docker-compose.yml` above or `openship up`.

## How It Works

Point Openship at a source — a **GitHub repo**, a **local folder**, or a **prebuilt artifact** — and it runs one pipeline end to end:

1. **Detect.** It reads your `package.json`, framework config, lockfiles, and any `docker-compose.yml` / `openship.json` to work out the stack, package manager, build/start commands, and port. Zero config files required; an `openship.json` overrides the guesses if you want control.
2. **Build.** On the target server or locally on the orchestrator, into a Docker image or a bare release. The resolved config is frozen into a snapshot, so redeploys and rollbacks re-run *exactly* what shipped.
3. **Run.** As a container (published on loopback only — never a public port) or a supervised host process.
4. **Route + secure.** The OpenResty edge writes a reverse-proxy vhost to your domain and issues a Let's Encrypt certificate (HTTP-01). Because routing and TLS happen *after* the app is up, a DNS or cert hiccup surfaces as "action required" — it never fails the deploy or takes your app down.
5. **Push-to-deploy.** A GitHub webhook re-runs the pipeline on every push to the tracked branch — rebuilding only the services a monorepo push actually touched.

Databases, domains, SSL, CDN, mail, and backups are managed from the same place. (Push-to-deploy and public domains need an always-on server or Cloud — a desktop/loopback instance has no public endpoint to receive webhooks.)

## Interfaces

Three ways to drive the same backend:

- **Desktop app** — full GUI, real-time logs, one-click everything. Best for solo.
- **Web dashboard** — the same UI in the browser, built for teams.
- **CLI** — scriptable and CI-friendly; also how you install and manage a self-hosted instance.

An **MCP** endpoint (for AI agents) and a **REST API** round it out for automation. Only routes that opt in are exposed as MCP tools, every call re-checks your permissions, and credential/token routes can never become tools. Full reference at [openship.io/docs](https://openship.io/docs).
